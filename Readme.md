#Benspopshop - Pattern Library

12.11.2013

There are plenty of excellent frameworks out there like [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) or [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/). The reason I made this small selection of UI elements, was to learn more about how code a pattern library. 

I have used Jonathan Snooks book [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/) as a base for the file structure, and i'm using less to add variables and mixins.
